# old-website
Code for my old website utilizing CSS/HTML. This version is no longer online.

This was the first website I made. I made it in around two weeks so it's not the most well-designed thing. Works fine, takes a while to load due to preview images just being scaled-down versions of the full-scale, 300 dpi versions found in their own pages.
