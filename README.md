# old-website
Code for my old website utilizing CSS/HTML. This is the version of my website that is currently up. It will be replaced once my remake of it is completed. 

This was the first website I made. I made it in around two weeks so it's not the most well-designed thing. Works fine, takes a while to load due to preview images just being scaled-down versions of the full-scale, 300 dpi versions found in their own pages. This is one of the issues I'm hoping to fix in the modern reincarnation I'm working on.

Makes minimal use of copypasted JavaScript. New website will have a more modern, less-clunky JavaScript image carousel.
